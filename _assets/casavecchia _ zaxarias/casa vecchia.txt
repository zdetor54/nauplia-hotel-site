The seaport town of Nafplion ,  capital of the  Prefecture of Argolis,   is situated on the northeastern tip of the Peloponnese.
It is located approximately 145 km from Athens, which is  a 1,5 hours’ drive and the route has clear signage .
Nafplion is a town that caters to the taste of all visitors; a variety of museums and sightseeing, plenty of bars and restaurants and  
also beach resorts.
Another key feature of the town is the fact that it is close to many archeological sites,  ideal for daily excursions :
Tiryns (4km), Mycenae (25km) and the Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus (30km), among others.

It is the first floor of a two storey house situated in a quiet area in the historic centre of Nafplion; its location is about 150 m.  
from the central square of the old town.
The house dates back to the second Venetian occupation. It was built in 1707 as a Venetian administrative building and during the second 
Turkish occupation it was the local pasha’s residence. After the Greek war of independence it became, for a certain period, the seat of the executive 
committee of the Greek government.
The 170 sq.m. apartment was renovated in 2010 and it is furnished with antiques while offering all modern amenities.
